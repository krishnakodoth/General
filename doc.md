## Source tree not starting

* <u>For me, the fix was to </u>

1. Navigate to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Atlassian
2. Under there, you will see SourceTree.exe_Url_RandomGuid
3. Delete all of those style folders so you are only left with one folder called SourceTree
4. Start SourceTree, and it will rebuild that settings file.
